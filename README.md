ðŸŒ± AI-Powered Precision Agriculture System ðŸšœ


The goal of this project is to design an AI-based precision agriculture system that analyzes soil parameters to offer personalized crop and fertilizer recommendations. Using IoT sensors to collect data on soil nutrients (NPK), moisture, temperature, pH, and humidity, the system will apply machine learning techniques to optimize farming decisions.This system aims to enhance crop productivity, reduce resource wastage, and promote environmentally sustainable farming practices.
